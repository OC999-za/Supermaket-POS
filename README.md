# Supermaket-POS
This serves as a personal assessment based on OOP Concepts. I envision the Point-Of-Sale System and the door Security Product Scanners working this way: The door Security Product Scanners trigger an alarm only if a product passes through without having been paid for(or successfully passing through the POS).
